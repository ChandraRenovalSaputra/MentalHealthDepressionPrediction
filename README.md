# MentalHealthDepressionPrediction
 A machine learning project leveraging XGBoost to predict depression risk. This repository includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with visualizations to interpret results. The model is designed to assist in mental health screening and provide insights into factors contributing to depression.

## Dataset

**Description**: The dataset used was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis. The feature distribution is close to the original dataset, although not completely the same. The original dataset can be used for further exploration or improving the performance of the model by integrating it in training.
